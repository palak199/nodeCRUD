# nodeCRUD
This is a basic implementation of MVC in node. It uses express.js and mongoose. It is super lightweight and easy to use, you can embed in your project and moduling is done:) plus i have commented each and every part so that node moduling doesn't be a pain in neck\


# Useful dependencies
to keep a watch on changes- nodemon\
and to use mongoose- \
npm install mongoose --save
